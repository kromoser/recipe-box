# Recipe Box

Recipe Box is a Sinatra application to help organize recipes from around the web. It is not intended for viewing recipe details and instructions, just a place to organize your favorite dishes. Users can browse by recipe, key ingredient, or recipe category, and then view the recipe with a recipe's associated link.
